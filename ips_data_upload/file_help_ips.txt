                                            as well as a config file.
                               <head_line>  specifies the field names for the data

                                            character which here is shown as a tilde.
                               <data_lines> specifies multiple field delimited data

                               By default debug is written to standard error
                               which can be written to a file using '2> file', e.g...

                                     be updated.  Or, for multiple ICOs on the object,
                                     just update the first one or all of its ICOs.

       Field Options...

          IcsClassID                 Inclass Class ID

                                     attribute IDs as required.

       NOTES...
       1) Use standard 'items' mode fields to specify item and rev details,
          in particular ItemID and RevID to specify the Item ID and optionally
          the Rev ID of the item or revision to classify.
          All other 'items' fields can be used to create or update items and revs too.
       2) The Class ID can be defaulted in the config file or provided in a field.
       3) If no IcoID or IcoPUID field is specified then the item ID specified will
          be used as the IcoID, or 'ItemID/RevID' if classifying the revision.
       4) To update individual ICOs classifing on an object which has multiple
          classifications then use the IcoPUID.
       5) To add multiple classification objects to one item or rev ensure UPDATE
          is OFF, otherwise only existing ICOs will be updated.
       6) By specifying a Class ID of 'UNCLASSIFY' an item or rev can be unclassified.
          This will remove ALL ICOs classifying the object.
